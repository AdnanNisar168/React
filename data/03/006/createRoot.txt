----GPT----
The code you provided is using React's Concurrent Mode and the ReactDOM.createRoot() method to render 
a React component (<App />) into the DOM. Concurrent Mode is an advanced feature in React that allows for more 
efficient rendering and improved user experience, especially in applications with complex UI and interactions.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

-> const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));: This line creates a "root" object using the ReactDOM.createRoot() method.
The document.getElementById('root') part finds an HTML element with the id "root" in the DOM, which is where the React component will 
be rendered. The createRoot method returns a "root" object that represents the root of your React application.
 It's a part of React's Concurrent Mode API.

-> root.render(<App />);: After creating the "root" object, you call the render() method on it to render the <App /> 
component into the specified DOM element ("root"). The <App /> component is written using JSX syntax, 
which is a convenient way to describe React components.

-> By using Concurrent Mode and createRoot(), you are taking advantage of React's improved rendering capabilities.
 It allows React to work on rendering components concurrently, prioritizing more important updates and
 potentially reducing jank in user interfaces, especially when dealing with asynchronous updates or complex rendering logic.

Note: Concurrent Mode and createRoot() are advanced features in React and may not be necessary for all projects. They are typically used in applications with high interactivity or complex rendering requirements.
