React uses Declarative approach



A declarative approach is a programming or problem-solving paradigm that focuses on 
describing what needs to be achieved or the desired outcome, rather than specifying
how to achieve it step by step. In other words, in a declarative approach, 
you declare the result you want, and the system or program figures out how to achieve that result.
This is in contrast to an imperative approach, where you specify a sequence of steps or instructions to achieve a particular goal.

ex:
creating an element "<p>"
inner text
